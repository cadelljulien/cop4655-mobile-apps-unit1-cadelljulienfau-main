## Notes

The challenge I faced starting off was with the stacks and constraints. I wanted both my image and 3 context labels to spreaded out evenly and straight. I didnt get it perfectly, but I still got it. The coding part was some what easy, as I followed along with what the lab did. The handling though of context info for detail view did somewhat give me problems but it was fixed right away.
